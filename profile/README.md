# Welcome to the ASCL Github
The Affective Science and Culture Lab is a research lab based out of Yale University in New Haven, CT, USA. We address questions such as why some people experience such a diverse range of emotions and how culture can facilitate and obstuct mutual understandings of each otherâ€™s mental states.

Our research focuses on the dynamic influences of social, affective, and cultural processes on emotional experience, emotion perception and their downstream consequences for the mind, behavior, and relationships. We employ a multi-method approach, including ambulatory, fieldwork, and lab-based studies using behavioral and physiological methods.

Feel free to take a look at the various repositories in our workspace, as the code should help you clean, analyze, and visualize a variety of types of data.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact our lab manager at yamini.pant@yale.edu
